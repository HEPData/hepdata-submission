  title: "Upper limit at 95% CL on the fiducial cross section for ℓ±ℓ± pairs from non-SM signals. The expected limits and their 1σ uncertainties are given together with the observed limits derived from the data. Limits are given separately for the e±e±,e±μ± and μ±μ± channel inclusively and separated by charge."
